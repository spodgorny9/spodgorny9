## Introduction

My name is Slater Podgorny and in June of 2022 I will be graduating from the University of Denver with a degree in Business Information and Analytics and minors in Environmental Science and Leadership Studies. I grew up in the small town of Paonia, Colorado and was appealed to the University of Denver because it would keep me close to the mountains. When I started at DU I was unsure about what I wanted to study but the reputation of the Daniels College of Business and the flexibility of many business degrees caught my attention. The Business Analytics program caught my attention due to the wild abundance of data today and the belief that data can help to address a lot of the world's problems. In an ideal world I would like to find a job that would allow me to connect my Environmental Science minor and Analytics major. This portfolio is intended to serve as a reflection on my experiences at DU and also document some of the class work that I completed within the past four years. Enjoy! 

## Community Engagement
### Asbury Elementary School

During my time at DU I was fortunate enough to participate in the Pioneer Leadership Program and one of the requirements for Freshman students is to pick a local organization that interests you and commit to volunteering with them throughout the year. The organization that I picked was a school right down the street from DU, Asbury Elementary School. For awhile now I have had a looming interest in being an educator and I think that is partially what guided me to volunteer at a school that would allow me to explore this interest in a little more depth. My volunteer time here involved helping in a first grade classroom and taking part in activities such as reading and writing lessons, grading, and creative projects. I am fairly positive that any of the students that I worked with would now longer remember me but watching their development, even in one short year, was incredibly rewarding for me and reminded me of the importantance of education. 

After completeing my volunteer time at Asbury I reached a few conclusions. I am still very interested in being involved in education and even though my degree does not directly cater to that interest, I can find ways to be involved without being a teacher. Another significant takeaway was that volunteering within a community is an invaluable way to get to know the community. I grew up in a very small town and never really moved so I got to know my community really well as I was growing up. When I came to DU this aspect of my life was relatively uprooted in a sense as I tried to familiarize myself with new places, people, and ways of life. Volunteering at Asbury provided a thorough understanding of the community around DU and helped me acclimate quickly. This is an idea I would like to keep in mind wherever I end up in the future.
