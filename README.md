## Introduction

<img align = "right" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98546888/161790392-4f16d520-5448-474d-8bee-b88a5b52ca8d.jpeg" alt = "drawing" width = "200"/> My name is Slater Podgorny and in June of 2022 I will be graduating from the University of Denver with a degree in Business Information and Analytics and minors in Environmental Science and Leadership Studies. I grew up in the small town of Paonia, Colorado and was appealed to the University of Denver because it would keep me close to the mountains. When I started at DU I was unsure about what I wanted to study but the reputation of the Daniels College of Business and the flexibility of many business degrees caught my attention. The Business Analytics program caught my attention due to the wild abundance of data today and the belief that data can help to address a lot of the world's problems. In an ideal world I would like to find a job that would allow me to connect my Environmental Science minor and Analytics major. This portfolio is intended to serve as a reflection on my experiences at DU and also document some of the class work that I completed within the past four years. Enjoy! 



### Why BIA? 

When I started at DU I was unsure about what I wanted to study and a little overwhelmed by all the options. I found myself gravitating towards the business school because of its reputation and the flexibilty that many business majors provide for future careers. My initial intent was to study International Business but when I was introduced to the Analytics program I was captivated. The growing scale and importance of data in our world fascinated me and my appreciation for problem solving and cool graphics nudged me towards analytics. It also dawned on me that a data focused degree would allow me to pursue just about any career I could possibly imagine and would give me a solid foundation to address some of the world's most significant challenges. All of these factors combined to assure me that analytics would cater to my intellectual interests and allow me to pursue the lifestyle and career I desire.

### Minors

I am currently pursing minors in Leadership Studies and Environmental Science. The leadership minor comes as a result of my participation in the Pioneer Leadership Program which is a living and learning community here at DU. I won't dive into this minor too much here because I expand on some of the details in the Community Engagement and Leadership section that is linked below.

My Environmental Science minor came as a result of a DU's common core requirement of taking a science sequence and the only one that happened to have seats available was Environmental Systems. Thinking about it now, I am so glad all other courses was full because the E-Systems course gave me the opportunity to explore a field that I always loved but maybe did not know that I was passionate about. While most of my peers loathed nine AM lectures, I jumped at the opportunity to learn about Geology, Hydrology, and Weather. I had this massive appreciation for the fact that we could talk about something in a lecture then drive an hour west on the weekends and witness the very same things we had talked about. I have realized that the topics of Environmental Systems absolutely fascinating to me and I hope that I can find a career that will allow me to connect my analytics skills with my environmental science passions.

The highlights of my time at DU are expanded in each of the links below.

## Reflections

It is pretty wild to me that my time at DU is coming to an end. It feels like just the other day I was telling my freshman self that these next four years would fly by and I need to appreciate each moment as much as I can. Nevertheless, my theory has proven true and graduation is approaching at an alarmingly rapid pace. With that in mind, now is as good a time as any to reflect on my experience.

I have three main takeaways from my time at DU and Daniels. The first is that data is absolutely everywhere. There were times when I questioned whether BIA was the right degree for me but I quickly realized that whatever my passions or interests may be in the future, data is likely to be involved and the skills I have developed over these past four years will prove to be valuable. My best evidence for this theory is that I have had professors that worked as consultants, educators, in renewable energy labs, and even for the Denver Nuggets. Data is everywhere. 

My second takeaway relates to the future of business. Multiple times throughout this program I found myself questioning and sometimes even loathing the reputation of business in our world today. To me it feels very clear that businesses are largely to blame for some of the biggest issues facing the world today and to be associated with that industry doesn't quite sit right with me. That being said, business is also the most practical and relevant solution that I can think of and approaching the challenges facing the world is going to demand a business world in which corporations are willing to take responsibility for their actions and begin to prioritize the public good.

Finally, my ultimate takeaway is an appreciation for the opportunity that college gave me to explore and understand who I am and who I want to be. I now feel as though I know more about myself than I did when I first walked across campus and I feel like I have a much clearer direction for where I would like to end up and the impact that I would like to have in the future. I really ready for whatever comes next.

## What's next?

This fall I am planning on starting a one year masters program in Business information and Analytics to further develop my analytics skills and explore topics in greater depth that I have been introduced to in undergrad. After that I would like to find a job in the outdoor industry in whatever form possible. This could come in many different forms but it has become clear to me that I care about working in a field that aligns with my passions and living somewhere that is close to the things I love doing in the outdoors.
