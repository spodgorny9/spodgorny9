## Introduction

My name is Slater Podgorny and in June of 2022 I will be graduating from the University of Denver with a degree in Business Information and Analytics and minors in Environmental Science and Leadership Studies. I grew up in the small town of Paonia, Colorado and was appealed to the University of Denver because it would keep me close to the mountains. When I started at DU I was unsure about what I wanted to study but the reputation of the Daniels College of Business and the flexibility of many business degrees caught my attention. The Business Analytics program caught my attention due to the wild abundance of data today and the belief that data can help to address a lot of the world's problems. In an ideal world I would like to find a job that would allow me to connect my Environmental Science minor and Analytics major. This portfolio is intended to serve as a reflection on my experiences at DU and also document some of the class work that I completed within the past four years. Enjoy!

## Community Engagement
Throughout my time at DU I was fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in some incredible community projects that addressed multiple issues facing the community around the University of Denver. My first engagement project took place just down the street from DU at Asbury Elementary where I volunteered in a first grade classroom. This experience allowed me to explore my interest in education and become involved in the incredible community that extends beyond the limits of the DU campus. Another significant engagement experience I took part in was the Community Change Initiative I took part in during my second year. As part of a class for the Pioneer Leadership Program, we were tasked with identifying an issue we care deeply about in our community and then working to address this problem. My group decided we would like to tackle mental health within youth communities by way of physical education which ultimately led us to working with the Boys and Girls Club of Metro Denver. As a whole, this project taught me about how difficult it can be to initiate community work but it also reminded me just how valuable that work is.

## Cultural Learning 
### Leadership and Sustainability in Belize 
Part of my interest in attending DU stemmed from their incredible international education program that encourages taking courses abroad. Over the past four years I have tried to take full advantage of this by taking courses in Belize and Ireland and studying abroad in Costa Rica for three months. My travels began in Belize during winter break of my freshman year through a course called Leadership and Sustainability in Belize. Despite the nation's relatively small size, it is widely regarded as a leader in the international sustainability movement due to its commitment to protecting natural spaces and pioneering the Ecotourism movement. <img align = "right" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98546888/160854860-5e44680e-684b-4ab0-84d3-135b213bbedf.jpeg" alt = "drawing" width = "300"/> This course gave us the opportunity to explore these practices and get to know the leaders that are behind them. We stayed in an Eco-lodge that was nestled in the heart of the Belizean rainforest and spent a few days in a dive lodge off the coast of Belize where we learned about the importance of using busines as a method to achieve sustainability. We also visited the Belize Zoo which only houses animals that are injured or have caused trouble in local communities and would otherwise be terminated. Some of the creatures in the zoo, such as the monkeys, were free to come and go as they please but generally stick around due to the level of care and promise of food that the zoo provides. We talked to so many incredible people during this trip and it led me to an irrefutable realization that it is possible for businesses to commit to sustainable practices and also operate successfully. This is something I hope to explore and pursue in my future career.

### Leadership in the Movement for Irish Independence
<img align = "left" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98546888/160854921-c3a1d1ab-7117-4583-aaa8-a1b9916f49bf.jpeg" alt = "drawing" width = "300"/> My second cultural immersion experience came during winter break of my sophomore year as I crossed the pond to take part in a class in Ireland. The focus of the class was studying the Irish independence movement and the individuals that drove the rebellion. We spent most of our time in Dublin hearing from local history experts that provided background on the events that sparked the rebellion. We were also able to tour many significant landmarks within Dublin before travelling to country side to visit cities such as Cork and Limmerick. I felt the most value of the course came from the opportunity to get to know the Irish culture a little bit and taking the time to explore different leaders and their styles of leadership. 

### Study Abroad in Costa Rica
My most recent and thorough cultural experience came during the fall of my senior year when I travelled to Costa Rica for three months to study abroad. My choice to study abroad in Costa Rica was driven by a few factors. Two of the main reasons were I wanted to go somewhere I could surf and also improve my Spanish speaking skills. Additionally, studying in Costa Rica gave me the opportunity to further explore the topics that I learned about in Belize. <img align = "right" src = "https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98546888/160854932-431b1dd4-f196-45b3-8829-a07480715417.jpeg" alt = "drawing" width = "300"/>  I took classes that focused on sustainability such as Ecotourism and Sustainable Lifestyles and I also took classes geared towards environmental science such as Tropical Ecology and Endangered Marine Species. While my classes did not have a particular business focus, they gave me the opportunity to complete my environmental science minor and take classes that are not necessarily offered at DU. I was able to participate in field trips to marine ecosystems and tropical rainforests and I was able to travel and surf nearly every weekend. While the travel and coursework from my time abroad were incredible, I think the most valuable part of my time came from the homestay experience.

I stayed with a Costa Rican family that lived just steps from the school. We spent nearly every night laughing around the dinner table or playing Uno instead of doing homework. Living with a local family is probably the best method to pursue cultural immersion and I am so grateful for the host family that took me in.
