## Introduction

My name is Slater Podgorny and in June of 2022 I will be graduating from the University of Denver with a degree in Business Information and Analytics and minors in Environmental Science and Leadership Studies. I grew up in the small town of Paonia, Colorado and was appealed to the University of Denver because it would keep me close to the mountains. When I started at DU I was unsure about what I wanted to study but the reputation of the Daniels College of Business and the flexibility of many business degrees caught my attention. The Business Analytics program caught my attention due to the wild abundance of data today and the belief that data can help to address a lot of the world's problems. In an ideal world I would like to find a job that would allow me to connect my Environmental Science minor and Analytics major. This portfolio is intended to serve as a reflection on my experiences at DU and also document some of the class work that I completed within the past four years. Enjoy!

## Community Engagement
Throughout my time at DU I was fortunate to have the opportunity to participate in some incredible community projects that addressed multiple issues facing the community around the University of Denver. My first engagement project took place just down the street from DU at Asbury Elementary where I volunteered in a first grade classroom. This experience allowed me to explore my interest in education and become involved in the incredible community that extends beyond the limits of the DU campus. Another significant engagement experience I took part in was the Community Change Initiative I took part in during my second year. As part of a class for the Pioneer Leadership Program, we were tasked with identifying an issue we care deeply about in our community and then working to address this problem. My group decided we would like to tackle mental health within youth communities by way of physical education which ultimately led us to working with the Boys and Girls Club of Metro Denver. As a whole, this project taught me about how difficult it can be to initiate community work but it also reminded me just how valuable that work is. If you would like to read more about my engagement experiences, you can find in-depth descriptions and write-ups [here.](https://github.com/spodgorny9/Community-Engagement)
